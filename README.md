# BLiNX-The-Time-Sweeper-Randomizer
The official repository for my BLiNX: The Time Sweeper Randomizer

This randomizer currently randomizes the following:
- Monsters
- (Optionally makes monsters have a 50% chance to drop gold instead of time crystals)
- Time crystals and gold
- Boss drops (instead of gold, you could get [Cones](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd2cdcc-1d69-4537-9d64-909325b358f0))
- Button and door types

And supports the following file types as input:
- Xbox Executables (XBE)
- XDVDFS (XISO images)

The end goal is to keep this compatible with every version of the game while randomizing as many gameplay elements as possible.

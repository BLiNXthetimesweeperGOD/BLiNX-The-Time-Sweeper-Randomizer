# BLiNX: The Time Sweeper Randomizer
The official repository for my BLiNX: The Time Sweeper Randomizer

This randomizer currently randomizes the following:
- Monsters
- (Optionally makes monsters have a 50% chance to drop gold instead of time crystals)
- Time crystals and gold
- Boss drops (instead of gold, you could get [Cones](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd2cdcc-1d69-4537-9d64-909325b358f0))
- Button and door types
- Various UI colors (the time control icons and save boxes)
- Shop item prices and visuals

And supports the following file types as input:
- Xbox Executables (XBE)
- XDVDFS (XISO images)

The end goal is to keep this compatible with every version of the game while randomizing as many gameplay elements as possible.

Another goal is to ensure the game is still beatable from start to finish - that's why Water Spirits and Fire Spirits don't get randomized into every stage.
